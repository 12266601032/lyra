# Lyra

*High availability RabbitMQ client*

## Introduction

Dealing with failure is a fact of life in distributed systems. Lyra is a [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) client that helps you achieve high availability in your services by embracing failure, allowing for AMQP resources such as connections, channels and consumers to be automatically recovered when server or network failures occur.

#### Features

* Automatic resource recovery
* Automatic invocation retries
* Event listeners
* Flexible configuration

## Setup

`mvn install`

Add the lyra dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.jodah</groupId>
  <artifactId>lyra</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Also add the latest [amqp-client] dependency:

```
<dependency>xml
  <groupId>com.rabbitmq</groupId>
  <artifactId>amqp-client</artifactId>
  <version>CURRENT-VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

#### Resource Recovery

The key feature of Lyra is its ability to automatically recover resources such as [Connections][Connection], [Channels][Channel] and [Consumers][Consumer] when unexpected failures occur. To start, create an `Options` object, specifying a recovery policy:

```java
Config config = new Config()
	.withRecoveryPolicy(new RetryPolicy()
		.withMaxRetries(100)
		.withInterval(Duration.seconds(1))
		.withMaxDuration(Duration.minutes(5)));
```

With our `options`, let's create a *recoverable* Connection along with some Channels and Consumers:

```java
Connection connection = Connections.create(config);
Channel channel1 = connection.createChannel(1);
Channel channel2 = connection.createChannel(2);
channel1.basicConsume("foo-queue", consumer1);
channel1.basicConsume("foo-queue", consumer2);
channel2.basicConsume("foo-queue", consumer3);
channel2.basicConsume("foo-queue", consumer4);
```

This results in the dependency hierarchy:

If the Connection is unexpectedly closed, Lyra will attempt to recover it along with its Channels and Consumers. If a Channel is unexpectedly closed, Lyra will attempt to recover it along with its Consumers.

#### Invocation Retries

Lyra also supports invocation retries when a *retryable* failure occurs while creating a Connection or invoking a method against a [Connection] or [Channel]. For example:

```java
Config config = new Config()
	.withRecoveryPolicy(RetryPolicies.retryAlways())
	.withRetryPolicy(new RetryPolicy()
		.withBackoff(Duration.seconds(1), Duration.seconds(30))
		.withMaxDuration(Duration.minutes(10)));
		
Connection connection = Connections.create(config);
Channel channel = connection.createChannel();
channel.basicConsume("foo-queue", myConsumer);
```

Here we've created a new `Connection` and `Channel`, specifying a recovery policy to use in case any of our resources are *unexpectedly* closed as a result of an invocation failure, and a retry policy that dictates how and when the failed method invocation should be retried. If the `Connections.create()`, `connection.createChannel()`, or `channel.basicConsume()` method invocations fail as the result of a *retryable* error, Lyra will attempt to recover any resources that were closed according to the recovery policy and retry the invocation according to the retry policy.

#### Event Listeners

Lyra offers [listeners](http://jodah.net/lyra/javadoc/net/jodah/lyra/event/package-summary.html) for creation and recovery events:

```java
Config config = new Config();
	.withConnectionListeners(myConnectionListener)
	.withChannelListeners(myChannelListener)
	.withConsumerListeners(myConsumerListener);
```

### Resource Configuration

Resources created through Lyra can be re-configured after creation by obtaining the configuration for the resource:

```java
ConfigurableConnection configurableConnection = Config.of(connection);
ConfigurableChannel configurableChannel = Config.of(channel);
```

Configurable connections and channels can be used the same as regular connections and channels, but expose additional configuration that overrides any configuration that was present when the resource was created.

## Additional Notes

#### On Recovery / Retry Policies

[Recovery / Retry policies](http://jodah.net/lyra/javadoc/net/jodah/lyra/retry/RetryPolicy.html) allow you to specify:

* The maximum number of retry attempts to perform
* The maxmimum duration that retries should be performed for
* The standard interval between retry attempts
* The maximum interval between retries to exponentially backoff to

Lyra allows for Recovery / Retry policies to be set globally or for individual resource types, as well as for initial connection attempts.

#### On Retryable Failures

Lyra will only retry failed invocations that are deemed *retryable*. These include connection errors that are not related to failed authentication, and channel or connection errors that might be the result of temporary network failures.

#### On Threading

When a Connection or Channel are closed as the result of an invocation:

* If recovery and retry policies are configured the calling thread will block until the Connection/Channel is recovered and the retry can be performed.
* If a retry policy is not configured the failure is immediately rethrown. Recovery will still take place in a background thread if a recovery policy is configured.

When a Connection or Channel are closed involuntarily (not as the result of an invocation), recovery occurs in a background thread if a recovery policy is configured.
